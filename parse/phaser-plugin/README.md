# PSD to JSON Phaser Plugin

PsdToJSON's phaser plugin is a bunch of convenience functions to get PSD to JSON up and running in your phaser project more quickly.

## ToDo

- [ ] placeAll() 
- [ ] Access loaded/nested content. (Move stuff, add physics, setPos, etc)
- [ ] Spritesheets
- [ ] Atlas
- [ ] Animation
- [ ] Root x/y (+ placing multiple psds in a single scene)
- [ ] Instance (loop back around to generate first)
- [ ] 

## Development

When developing, run : `npm run watch` to build plugin on save.

To link plugin to your project locally, run `npm link` in this folder, and then `npm link psd-to-json-plugin` in the project you'd like to use it in.

(To reset, just run the same commands with `unlink`.)
