This is a bunch of convenience functions to get PSD to JSON up and running in your phaser project.

## Development

When developing, run : `npm run watch` to build plugin on save. 

To link plugin to your project locally, run `npm link` in this folder, and then `npm link psd-to-json-plugin` in the project you'd like to use it in.

(To reset, just run the same commands with `unlink`.)
