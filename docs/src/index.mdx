# PSD to Phaser

psd-to-phaser is a Phaser plugin that reads the JSON manifest created by [psd-to-json](https://pypi.org/project/psd-to-json/), loads the files and then does the work of rebuilding the PSD.

It also has some nifty extras like [lazy loading](/posts/cameras/) and a few presets that I thought might be useful ([parallax](/posts/presets/) and [build-your-own-joystick](/posts/presets/) being my favorites.)

## Initializing the Plugin

You can initialize the plugin when creating your game's configuration object:

```js
new Phaser.Game({
  // ...
  plugins: {
    global: [
      {
        key: "PsdToPhaser",
        plugin: PsdToPhaser,
        start: true,
        mapping: "P2P", // all examples assume you're mapping to P2P
        data: {
          debug: {
            shape: false, // outline all items
            label: false, // text labels for all objects
            console: false, // output placement & progress info to console
          },
          applyAlphaAll: false, // apply alpha value to all items by default
          applyBlendModesAll: false, // apply blendMode of all items by default
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Getting Started

To get started with PSD to Phaser, you'll need:

1. A PSD file processed with [psd-to-json](https://pypi.org/project/psd-to-json/)
2. The Phaser game engine
3. The psd-to-phaser plugin

Check out the [Installation](/installation/) guide to get up and running quickly.
