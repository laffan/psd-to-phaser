# PSD to Phaser

psd-to-phaser is a Phaser plugin that reads the JSON manifest created by [psd-to-json](https://pypi.org/project/psd-to-json/), loads the files and then does the work of rebuilding the PSD.

It also has some nifty extras like [lazy loading](/posts/cameras/) and a few presets that I thought might be useful ([parallax](/posts/presets/) and [build-your-own-joystick](/posts/presets/) being my favorites.)

Check out the [Installation](/installation/) guide to get up and running quickly.
