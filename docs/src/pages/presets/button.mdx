Create interactive buttons with visual states and customizable callbacks. Accepts two objects: `images` (what is displayed) and `callbacks` (what happens on interaction).

```js
// Simple button with click callback
this.P2P.use.button([this.buttonNormal, (btn) => {
  console.log("clicked");
}]);

// Button with hover image (3-parameter shorthand)
this.P2P.use.button([this.buttonNormal, this.buttonHover, (btn) => {
  console.log("clicked");
}]);

// Full object syntax with all images and callbacks
this.P2P.use.button([
  {
    normal: this.buttonNormal,
    hover: this.buttonHover,
    active: this.buttonPressed
  },
  {
    click: (btn) => console.log("clicked"),
    mouseOver: (btn) => console.log("mouse over"),
    mouseOut: (btn) => console.log("mouse out"),
    mousePress: (btn) => console.log("pressed down")
  }
]);
```

**Image States:**
- **normal**: Default image (required)
- **hover**: Image shown on mouse over (desktop only, optional)
- **active**: Image shown while pressed down (optional)

**Callback Types:**
- **click**: Triggered on button release
- **mouseOver**: Triggered when mouse enters button area (desktop only)
- **mouseOut**: Triggered when mouse leaves button area (desktop only)
- **mousePress**: Triggered when button is pressed down

**How it works:** The button function automatically manages which image is visible based on user interaction. Only the appropriate image for the current state is shown, while others are hidden.

**Mobile Support:** Hover states automatically work on desktop with mouse interaction but are disabled on mobile devices to prevent conflicts with touch events.
