Make any placed object move at a different speed than the camera scroll, creating a parallax effect.

```js
const psd = this.P2P.place(this, 'psd_key', 'root');

const distantItem = psd.target('distant');

this.P2P.use.parallax({
  target: distantItem,
  scrollFactor: 0.25
});
```

This defaults to the main camera, but accepts a `camera` parameter, allowing you can pass in a different target camera.
