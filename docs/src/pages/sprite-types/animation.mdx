Animations automatically play when placed. However, you can override the default animation properties at several points.

1. Layer naming : In the PSD itself, the attributes of the layer name itself can control animation properties. If you pass valid animation parameters, they will be merged in when instantiating the animation.

```
S | bounce | animation | frameRate: 5, yoyo: true
```

2. Instantiation : When instantiating the sprite, you can also pass in animation parameters, so the same thing could be acheived like so :

```js
// For individual sprites
this.bounce = this.P2P.place(this, "psd_key", "nested/bounce");
  animationOptions: {
    frameRate: 5,
    yoyo: true,
  },
});
```

3. Using get() : You can always use get() to retreive the sprite and then use updateAnimation():

```js
this.bounce = this.P2P.place(this, "psd_key", "nested/bounce");

this.bounce.updateAnimation({
  frameRate: 5,
  yoyo: true,
});
```
