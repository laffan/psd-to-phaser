If you would like to target a portion of a placed group - or a portion of a placed group - and assign it to a new variable, you can use the copy() method. You can also deactivate the targeted items in the original, giving the impression that the original object is being affected.

```js
// Place item
const placedGroup = this.P2P.place(this, "psd_key", "placedGroup");

// Use target to apply method to portion of target
const lightened = placedGroup.target("iAmAtlas").setAlpha(0.3);

// Chain several methods on target
placedGroup.target("surround").setAlpha(0.3).setX(200); // chain methods

// Assign target to a new variable and update it that way.
const = L1Text = placedGroup.target("depthTest/Level1/Level1Text");
L1Text.setAlpha(0.3)

// Get  the points which make up a placed Zone
const zone = placedGroup.target("depthTest/zone1");
const points = zone.getData('points');
```

```js 

// Place background
this.P2P.place(this, 'p4_key', 'background');
this.face = this.P2P.place(this, 'p4_key', 'face');


// Use target to apply method to portion of target
const rightEye = this.face.target("rightEye");

// You can also use target on targeted items
const rightEyeDot = rightEye.target("dot");

// Now you can apply changes to just a portion.
rightEye.setScale(2);
rightEyeDot.setScale(.5);

```
