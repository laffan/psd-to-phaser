Once a sprite has been loaded, you can easily grab its texture and use it elsewhere, like particle emitters or placing individual frames of an atlas or spritesheet.

Note : When placing new items, remember the [depth gotchya](/pages/other/gotchas).

### Using with Particles

Once you have access to the texture you can use the frames in any normal Phaser context, like emitting particles.
