The `getData()` method returns the base path, where the data has been saved (`basePath`), the JSON manifest in its entirity (`original`), the initially loaded items (`initialLoad`) and finally any items that are being lazy loaded (`lazyLoad`).

```js
// Save all PSD data to a variable
const psdData = this.P2P.getData("psd_key");

// "basePath" is where the PSD data is stored.
const psdPath = psdData.basePath;

// "original" is the entire JSON blob. 
const psdWidth = psdData.original.width;
```
