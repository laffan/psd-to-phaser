title: Camera Overview
---

P2P has a few camera functions that help optimize your project and get you started with some basic interaction styles.

You can add these functions to any camera by passing it in to the `createCamera` function. The basic syntax is:

```js
this.P2P.createCamera(camera, features, options?)
```

- **camera**: The Phaser camera to enhance (usually `this.cameras.main`)
- **features**: Array of feature names (`['draggable']`, `['lazyLoad']`, etc.)
- **options**: Optional configuration object for the features

At the moment, there are camera features: `lazyLoad` and `draggable`.

**Camera features default to applying to all PSDs.** For `lazyLoad`, you can specify which PSDs to target using the `targetKeys` option.
