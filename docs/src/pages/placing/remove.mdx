Any placed item comes with a remove method, which lets you search through the placed structure and destroy certain items.

```js
const placedGroup = this.P2P.place(this, "psd_key", "placedGroup");

placedGroup.remove("innerGroup", { depth: 1 }); // removes only immediate children
placedGroup.remove("innerGroup"); // removes all descendants from this point
```
