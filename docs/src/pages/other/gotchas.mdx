####  Depth & placing your own items.

The plugin maintains layer order with setDepth(), starting from 0 and extending to the number of layers in your PSD. This means that **it is very likely that new items will be hidden behind something**. 

When placing something of your own, make sure you set its depth to something higher than the number of layers you're bringing in from the PSD.
