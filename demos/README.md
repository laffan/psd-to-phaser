# PSD to Phaser Demos

This is (will be) an ongoing set of demos that serve to both showcase the various features of the tool and help me further debug it.


## Basic Parsing

Very simple demos of how the tool works, alongside some fun recipes for how different aspects of the tool might be used in conjunction with one another. For installation & usage instructions, check out its [README](/demos/basic-parsing/README.md).
