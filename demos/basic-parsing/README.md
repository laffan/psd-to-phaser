# PSD to JSON Platformer Example

An example of how to use PSDtoJSON in a real-world phaser project.  

This is regular vite/phaser site with [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) added to keep track of changes that psd-to-json makes to the public folder.

## Installation

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Goal

Get the original PSD fully visible with a platformer character moving through it & zones/pickups/platforms all working as expected.
