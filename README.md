# PSD to Phaser 

### âœ¨ Generate assets from the layers of a .psd file and parse them in Phaser. ðŸŽ‰

The `psd` filetype is a common export option for most raster art applications these days.  This tool, inspired by [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and powered by [psd_tools](https://pypi.org/project/psd-tools/), gives the users of these applications a way to easily translate their work in to an interactive space, powered by [a top notch gaming engine](https://phaser.io/).

This repo is composed of three parts: 

### 1. Generator 

If you've named your layers properly, the generator turns them in to a series of optimized assets, along with a sensibly formatted JSON file. It's smart enough to output sprites, spritesheets, atlases, tiles and even animations! (As a standalone tool, this could be useful to just about anyone who uses psds to create assets, regardless of where they're headed.)

Learn more in the [ðŸ“„ Generator README](./generator/README.md).

### 2. Plugin 

The PSD-to-Phaser plugin parses the JSON from the generator and provides a series of helper functions to display and manipulate the psd in your Phaser project. It also has some nifty extras like [lazyLoading](/plugin/README.md#lazyload) and a [build-your-own-joystick](/plugin/README.md#joystick-sprite-zone-key) preset. 

Learn more in the [ðŸ“„ Plugin README](./plugin/README.md).

### 3. Demos

The demos give a very high-level look at what is possible with this tool.  At the moment, there are two : 

1. [Introduction](/demos/1_introduction/) - The absolute bare-bones to get you up and running.

2. [Platformer](/demos/2_platformer/) - A simple platformer that you can use as a template for your own projects. (Could be a nearly no-code way to make a game with just Procreate.)

I'll be adding to this list as I use the tool more myself.


## Credits / Authorship

The first and second versions of this project (you're looking at something like version 3.5) were almost entirely generated by Claude Opus over the first couple weeks of July 2024. I can take credit as API designer, architect and chief copy-and-paster, but apart from some very light debugging I just sat back and watched the coding happen. 

This means that the bones are neither [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) nor terribly optimized.  What you see now has been heavily edited, but I have not done a full rewrite.  It's not _as_ hairy a mess as the first couple versions, and a lot of time during version 2 was spent guiding Claude to make better choices, but ... you have been warned. 

This is a proof of concept that seems to work well, but beyond that I make no promises.

Use it however you want, just don't sell it as your own work. I hope you find this idea to be as much fun as I do.
