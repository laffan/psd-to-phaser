# PSD to JSON 

Styled off of tools like [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), this is an proof-of-concept project, showing how PSDs could be used to automatically generate assets and data and parsed by Phaser.  

## Generator

This is a series of python scripts that uses psd_tools to break up the PSD, read positions, attributes, etc and then output a JSON blob with a series of optimized assets.  You can read more about how to use the generator in its [README](./generator/README.md).

## Parser

A few javascript tools to help parse the JSON blob in your project.  Includes helper functions for the Phaser and Fabric libraries to get you off the ground a little more quickly.  Learn more about the parse in its [README](./plugin/README.md).

## Demos

An ongoing set of demos that show off what the tool is capable of. See some basic introductions in the [README](/demos/README.md)

## Credits / Authorship

The first and second versions of this project was almost entirely generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet over the course of 5 days in 2024. I can take credit as API designer, architect and chief copy-and-paster, but apart from some very light debugging I just sat back and watched the coding happen. 

This means that this code is neither [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) nor  optimized in any way.  It's not as hairy a mess as the first couple versions, and a lot of time was spent guiding Claude to make certain choices, but I'm sure anyone who actually knows Python and Typescript well will wince when the look under the hood.
