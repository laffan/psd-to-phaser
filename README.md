# PSD to Phaser 

Automatically generate assets and data from PSD layers before parsing them in Phaser.  

The `psd` filetype is a common export option for most raster art applications these days.  This tool, inspired by [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) and powered by [psd_tools](https://pypi.org/project/psd-tools/), gives the users of these applications a way to easily translate their work in to an interactive space, powered by [a top notch gaming engine](https://phaser.io/).

This repo is composed of three parts: 

### 1. Generator

The generator uses psd_tools to break up a PSD, generate a JSON file from its layer data and then output a series of optimized assets.  It depends on a naming convention that you can read more about in the [README](./generator/README.md).

### 2. Plugin

The (Phaser) plugin parses the JSON that the generator creates and provides a series of helper functions to display and manipulate the layers in your phaser project. It also has some nifty extras like lazyLoading and a build-your-own-joystick preset. Read more in the [README](./plugin/README.md).

### 3. Demos

The demos are a few simple examples of what is possible with this tool.  At the moment, there are two : 

1. [Introduction](/demos/1_introduction/) - The absolute bare-bones to get you up and running.

2. [Platformer](/demos/2_platformer/) - A simple platformer that you can use as a template for your own projects.

I'll be adding to this list as I use the tool more myself.


## Credits / Authorship

The first and second versions of this project (you're looking at something like version 3.5) were almost entirely generated by Claude Opus over the first couple weeks of July 2024. I can take credit as API designer, architect and chief copy-and-paster, but apart from some very light debugging I just sat back and watched the coding happen. 

This means that the bones are neither [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) nor terribly optimized.  What you see now has been heavily edited, but I have not done a full rewrite.  It's not _as_ hairy a mess as the first couple versions, and a lot of time during version 2 was spent guiding Claude to make better choices, but ... you have been warned.

## License

Use it however you want, just don't sell it as your own work. I hope you find this idea to be as much fun as I do.
