# üñºÔ∏è PSD to Phaser ‚ú®

psd-to-phaser is a Phaser plugin that reads the JSON manifest created by [psd-to-json](https://pypi.org/project/psd-to-json/), loads the files and then does the work of rebuilding the PSD.

## Development

Want to make develop the plugin locally?  Run : `npm run watch` in this folder to build plugin on save.

To link plugin to your project locally, run `npm link` in this folder, and then `npm link psd-to-phaser` in the project you'd like to use it in.

(To reset, just run the same commands with `unlink`.)

## Credits / Authorship

The first and second versions of this project (you're looking at something like version 3.5) were almost entirely generated by Claude Opus over the first couple weeks of July 2024. I take credit as API designer, architect and chief copy-and-paster, but apart from some very light debugging I only guided the bot.

This means that while the conceptual bones are pretty solid, the files themselves are neither [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) nor terribly well optimized.   It's not _as_ hairy a mess as the first couple versions, and a lot of time during version 2 was spent guiding Claude to make better choices, but ... you have been warned: this is a proof of concept that works well, but beyond that I make no promises.

## License

Use it however you want, just don't sell it as your own work. I hope you find this idea to be as much fun as I do.
