# PSD to Phaser 

[Automatically generate](/generator/) assets and data from a PSD before parsing [parsing them easily](/plugin/) for your next [phaser project](/demos/introduction/). [Batteries included](/generator/README.md#generate-on-save).

This is a proof-of-concept, inspired by [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), powered by [psd_tools](https://pypi.org/project/psd-tools/) and [coded by robots](#credits--authorship). 

## Generator

This is a series of python scripts that uses psd_tools to break up the PSD, read positions, attributes, etc and then output a JSON blob with a series of optimized assets.  You can read more about how to use the generator in its [README](./generator/README.md).

## Parser

A few javascript tools to help parse the JSON blob in your project.  Includes helper functions for the Phaser and Fabric libraries to get you off the ground a little more quickly.  Learn more about the parse in its [README](./plugin/README.md).

## Demos

An ongoing set of demos that show off what the tool is capable of. See some basic introductions in the [README](/demos/README.md)

## Known Issues 

- [ ] Spritesheets are shifted a bit to the right when placed.

## Credits / Authorship

The first and second versions of this project were almost entirely generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet over the first couple weeks of July 2024. I can take credit as API designer, architect and chief copy-and-paster, but apart from some very light debugging I just sat back and watched the coding happen. 

Apart from being the stuff of science fiction, this means that this code is neither [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) nor optimized in any way.  It's not _as_ hairy a mess as the first couple versions, and a lot of time was spent guiding Claude to make certain choices, but anyone actually knows Python and Typescript well will wince when they look under the hood.

Use it however you want, just don't sell it as your own work. I hope you find it to be as much fun as I do.
