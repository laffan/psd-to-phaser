# Starter

This is an empty phaser project built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) added to keep track of changes that psd-to-json makes to the public folder. psd-to-phaser has been added as a dependency in package.json and a plugin in main.js, but is otherwise not initialized.

## Installation

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```
